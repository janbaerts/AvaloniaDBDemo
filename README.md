# AvaloniaDBDemo
Demo van Avalonia met SQLite (Research Project)

In this repository you'll find a simple Gamers Club member app, that connects to a SQLite database using the SQLite Framework.
In order to run it on OSX or Linux, please download and install the .NET core SDK (2.1), go into the folder (/AvaloniaDBDemo) containing
the project (AvaloniaDBDemo.csproj) and execute "dotnet run --framework netcoreapp2.1" and it should work.

Addendum:
Noticed that it's better to first clone the repository into your VS and do a build. Then copy the AvaloniaDBDemo folder to
your OSX or Linux, I had some OSX crash running it directly.
